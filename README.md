### "<a href="https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?t=6">Hello there</a>"

My name is Nick Frichette, I'm a Penetration Tester and Team Lead for a large financial services company. My primary areas of focus are on web applications, AWS, and CI/CD exploitation.

This GitHub profile contains a bunch of stuff, and some of it is "good". You can find most of my research at my [blog](https://frichetten.com/blog). I'm also the primary maintainer of [Hacking the Cloud](https://hackingthe.cloud/), an encyclopedia of the techniques that offensive security professionals can use on their next cloud exploitation adventure.

I'm also fortunate to be a part of the [AWS Community Builders Program](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/).

## Vulnerability Research
In my off time I do security research, primarily focused on AWS.
