### "<a href="https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?t=6">Hello there</a>"

My name is Nick Frichette. I'm a Penetration Testing Team Lead for a large financial services company. This GitHub profile contains a bunch of stuff, and some of it is "good". My primary areas of focus are on web applications, AWS, and containerization technologies.
