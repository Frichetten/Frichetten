### "<a href="https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?t=6">Hello there</a>"

My name is Nick Frichette and I'm a Staff Security Researcher, primarily focused on cloud, web application, and CI/CD exploitation. Previously, I worked as a Penetration Tester and Team Lead for a large financial services company. In addition, I'm the creator and primary maintainer of [Hacking the Cloud](https://hackingthe.cloud/), an encyclopedia of the techniques that offensive security professionals can use against cloud environments.

Aside from that, I'm fortunate to be a part of the [AWS Community Builders Program](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/).

This GitHub profile contains a bunch of stuff, and some of it is "good". You can find most of my research at my [blog](https://frichetten.com/blog).

## Vulnerability Research
I conduct security research both, professionally and as a hobby. My primary focus is on AWS and web application security.
