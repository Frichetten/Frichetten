### "<a href="https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?t=6">Hello there</a>"

My name is Nick Frichette. I'm a Penetration Tester and Team Lead for a large financial services company. This GitHub profile contains a bunch of stuff, and some of it is "good". My primary areas of focus are on web applications, AWS, and containerization technologies.

In my off time I do vulnerability research, play CTFs, contribute to open source, and write at my [blog](https://frichetten.com/blog).
